- tried id 2 for view post and found flag 
    - idea should come by knowing there are private posts
    - could have found accessing admin profile by bruteforcing ids

- flag3 hint is 189 * 5
    - tried to view post with this id and found flag
    - probably should have bruteforced different ids

- id of post for deleting is weird
    - example
        - post id = 11
        - delete id =    6512bd43d9caa6e02c990b0a82652dca
        - id in cookie = c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c
    - those strange ids are md5 hashes

- id in cookie is also md5 hash of user id
    - set cookie id with value md5 hash of 1
        - found last flag
